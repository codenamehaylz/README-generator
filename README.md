## Installation
Download or clone this repository, then use the command line (i.e. Git Bash) to navigate to the README-generator folder. To be able to run the program you must first enter `npm install`. To start the program, enter `node index.js`.

## Usage
You will be prompted with several questions about your project, one at a time. Simply type in or select your answer and then press enter to submit. It will ask you for: Project title, description, installation guide, usage guide, license used, how to contribute, how to test, your github username, and your email address. A markdown file called gen-README.md will then be created and saved in the current directory.
